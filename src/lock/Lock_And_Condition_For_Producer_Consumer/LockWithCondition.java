/**
 * Condition variables are instance of java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition class,
 * which provides inter-thread communication methods similar to wait, notify and notifyAll
 * e.g. await(), signal(), and signalAll().
 * So if one thread is waiting on a condition by calling condition.await()
 * the second thread can call condition.signal() or condition.signalAll() method
 * to notify that its time to wake-up, the condition has been changed.
 * <p>
 * Lock with condition is good for solving producer_consumer_programs. see how to
 * use synchronized keyword to solve producer consumer programs in
 * "producer_consumer_Buffer_withaccessCondition" package
 * <p>
 * Synchronized way for P_C programs is harder than lock+condition, but oo blockingQueue oo is
 * the easiest solution among the three options
